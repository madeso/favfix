# favfix

The goal of the project is to load favorites (from firefox) or general http(s) links from a text file and categorize them.

The current goal is to realize this by
1. Loading them
2. Downloading each page
3. Perhaps extracting the content to a more readable format
4. Asking a LLM through a local LM Studio server to add tags based on the content
5. Provide tools for manually sorting and grouping them based on thoose tags.
6. Perhaps some user manually tagging as well or get "tags" from searching the link on reddit or [del.icio.us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)) like site.
